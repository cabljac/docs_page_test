## zoom image test

Testing the zoom image feature:

A normal "img" with width set, no zooming here, but a click link to
open it and view it as a full page works fine.

[<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/docs_page_test/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-d-07.png?raw=true" width="200"/>](https://github.com/rydmike/docs_page_test/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-d-07.png?raw=true)

An "Image" with width set and zoom. How to zoom this image?
Trying with ZOOM true set as well, did not help.

<Image src="https://github.com/rydmike/docs_page_test/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-d-07.png?raw=true" width="200"
caption="Zoomable image - how?" zoom />

Let's see where the caption is. The spacing is VERY large between the image
and the caption, I would prefer it to be closer, can I change it? How?


Another attempt with relative repo link for "zoomable" image:

<Image src="/images/fcs-v5-d-07.png" width="150"
caption="Zoomable image - Second try" zoom />
